Although Micronaut is primarily designed around message encoding / decoding, there are occasions where it is convenient to render a view on the server side.

To use the view rendering features, add the following dependency on your classpath. For example, in `build.gradle`

[source,java]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
  ...
  ..
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=views]
}
----

To use https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] Java template engine, add the thymeleaf dependency:

[source,java]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
  ...
  ..
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=thymeleaf]
}
----
